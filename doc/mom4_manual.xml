   <title>What is MOM?</title>
   <para>
     The Modular Ocean Model (MOM) is a numerical representation of the ocean's
     hydrostatic primitive equations, and it is designed primarily as a tool
     for studying the global ocean climate system. MOM4 is the latest
     version of the GFDL ocean model whose origins date back to the pioneering
     work of Kirk Bryan and Mike Cox in the 1960s-1980s. It is developed and
     supported by researchers at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory
     (<ulink url="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov">GFDL</ulink>), with contributions
     also provided by researchers worldwide. 
   </para>
   <para>
     The first release of MOM4 took place January of 2004. There have
     been four releases of this code: MOM4p0a (Jan 2004), MOM4p0b
     (March 2004), MOM4p0c (August 2004), and MOM4p0d (May 2005).
     The developers welcome
     feedback, both positive and negative, on the code's integrity and
     portability as well as documentation.
     It is through such feedback that the code and documentation evolves
     and becomes more robust and user friendly.
   </para>
   <para>
     The purpose of this web guide is to provide general information about
     MOM4 and particular information for how to download and run the code.

   <para>
     There have been four releases of MOM4p0: (1) MOM4p0a was
     released January 2004, (2) MOM4p0b was released March 2004, and
     (3) MOM4p0c was released August 2004, and (4) MOM4p0d released
     May 2005. Each release is documented on this web page.

   <title>Ongoing issues</title>
   <para>
  There are two major algorithm issues that are being addressed by GFDL
developers. (1) Generalized quasi-Eulerian vertical coordinates are
being implemented in MOM4. It is anticipated that MOM4p1a will have
this capability, with a release date hopefully late 2005. (2) Two-way
nesting is being considered for MOM. It is hoped that nesting will be
available also late 2005 or early 2006.
    
   </para>
   <para>
   There remains two general ways to compile mom4: with static allocation
of arrays or dynamic allocation.  Recent work on the SGI machines at
GFDL has reduced the difference in efficiency between these two
compilations.  We understand that on some platforms, the dynamic
allocation actually is better than static.  Such remains an ongoing
issue, as do other elements of code efficiency.  Our general goal is
to provide code that is efficient across a broad range of computer
platforms, but not at the cost of sacrificing portability.  Those who
know they will be working with one particular platform for a period of
time should readily find better ways of coding some parts of mom4 and
the associated FMS code.  If you feel your efficiency improvements are
of a general nature and wish to have them distributed in future MOM4
releases, we would be happy for you to contribute the modified code.

   <title>Complete tree of embedded documentation</title>

      The documentation of most Fortran modules in FMS is inserted right
      in the source code to ensure consistency between the code and
      documentaion. A Perl software is used to extract documentation
      from the source code to create a corresponding .html module.
      For example, documentation for
      shared/diag_manager/diag_manager.F90 module is
      shared/diag_manager/diag_manager.html. In general, the embedded
      documentation is a good starting point to understand the Fortran module.
      Here is a

     Although MOM4 shares much in common with earlier versions of MOM, it
     possesses a number of computational, numerical, and physical
     characteristics that are noteworthy. The following provides an overview
     of the main characteristics of MOM4 (please refer to
     <ulink

       MOM4 meets the code standards set by the GFDL Flexible Modeling System
       (<ulink url="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/~fms">FMS</ulink>). It also
       utilizes a substantial number of software infrastructure modules shared
       by other FMS-based models. In particular, all I/O (e.g., restarts,
       forcing fields, initial fields) is handled via

       The dynamics/kinematics for MOM4p0a and MOM4p0b are based on
       the non-Boussinesq method of Greatbatch et al. (2002). The
       Boussinesq option is available via a namelist.  This option was
       jettisoned in MOM4p0c for purposes of code brevity, and in
       anticipation of using pressure coordinates in MOM4p1 to realize
       non-Boussinesq dynamics.
     </listitem>

       The time tendency for tracer and baroclinic velocity can be
       discretized two ways. (1) The first approach uses the
       traditional leap-frog method along with a Robert-Asselin time
       filter. Note that the Euler forward or Euler backward mixing
       time step used in earlier MOMs has been eliminated.  This
       method is avalable in MOM4p0a, MOM4p0b and MOM4p0c. (2) MOM4p0c
       provides an additional method, which is strongly recommended.
       Here, the time tendency is discretized with a two-level forward
       step, which eliminates the need to time filter.  Tracer and
       velocity are staggered in time, thus providing second order
       accuracy in time.  For certain model configurations, this
       scheme is roughly twice as stable as the leap-frog, thus
       allowing for a factor of two in computational savings.  Without
       the time filtering needed with the leap-frog, the new scheme
       conserves total tracer to within numerical roundoff.  This
       scheme shares much in common with time stepping used in the
       Hallberg Isopycnal Model and the MIT GCM.  It is the default in
       MOM4p0c.  Details of both the leap-frog and two-level schemes
       are provided in

       The sole external mode solver is a variant of the Griffies et
       al. (2001) explicit free surface. There are two time stepping
       schemes supported: (1) leap-frog and (2) predictor-corrector.
       The predictor-corrector is more stable and is thus the default
       method.  Top model grid cells have time dependent volume, thus
       allowing for total tracer to be conserved to within roundoff.
       The linearized free surface method used in MOM3 (and many other
       implementations of the free surface in z-models) has been
       jettisoned since it precludes tracer conservation.  Details are

       Tracer advection is available using various schemes.  The

       documented in <ulink
       url="http://www.gfdl.gov/~smg/MOM/web/guide_parent/guide_parent.html">The
       MOM3 Manual of Pacanowski and Griffies (1999)</ulink>.  The 4th
       and 6th order schemes assume constant grid spacing, which
       simplifies the code though compromises accuracy on the more
       commonly used non-uniform grids.  The Quicker scheme documented
       by Holland et al. (1998) and
       <ulink
       url="http://www.gfdl.gov/~smg/MOM/web/guide_parent/guide_parent.html">The
       MOM3 Manual</ulink> is available.  Finally, two
       multi-dimensional flux limited schemes have been ported from
       the MIT GCM.  These schemes are monotonic and have been found to
       be roughly the same cost as the Quicker scheme.  GFDL
       researchers have found the Sweby scheme to be most satisfying
       for many applications, such as biogeochemistry.  Hence, effort
       has been made to enhance this scheme's efficiency in MOM4p0c.
       Other schemes remain much as they were with the MOM4p0a
       release.

   <title>Test cases</title>
   <para>
     MOM4 is distributed with a set of test cases located in
     <filename>mom4/exp/</filename>. These tests are taken from models used at
     <ulink url="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov">GFDL</ulink> for testing the
     numerical and computational integrity of the code.
   </para>
   <warning>
     These experiments are <emphasis>NOT</emphasis> sanctioned for their
     physical relevance. They are instead provided for the user to learn how to
     run MOM4, and to verify the numerical and/or computational integrity of
     the code. <emphasis>PLEASE</emphasis> do not assume that the experiments
     will run for more than the short time selected in the sample runscripts.
   </warning>
   <para>
     <filename>mom4_test1</filename>: This experiment consists of a
     flat bottom sector domain and uses very simple physics. This
     experiment is very small and can be easily run on a single
     workstation. It should provide the user with a basic experience
     of running mom4.
   </para>
   <para>
     <filename>mom4_test2</filename>: This experiment consists of a
     flat bottom sector domain and it uses more realistic physics
     options. This experiment has the same grid as
     <filename>test1</filename>, but it more thoroughly exercises the
     model's various physics packages.  Since the domain is small, it
     should be accessible to those with single workstations, though it
     will be slower than mom4_test1 due to the use of more realistic
     physical parameterizations.
   </para>
   <para>
     <filename>mom4_test3A</filename>: This experiment consists of an
     east-west channel using open boundary conditions at the western
     end of the channel. This experiment provides an illustration of
     the open boundary condition capability of MOM4. Tracers include
     potential temperature and salinity.
   </para>
   <para>
     <filename>mom4_test3B</filename>: This experiment consists of an
     solid wall on all four sides and with a domain twice as long as
     the open boundary condition
     <filename>test3A</filename>. This experiment is used to verify
     the relevance of the open boundary solution from
     <filename>test3A</filename> solution at early times. That is, for
     early times, the solution from
     <filename>test3A</filename> should closely (though not bitwise)
     agree with that from
     <filename>test3B</filename>. Tracers include potential
     temperature and salinity.
   </para>
   <para>
     <filename>mom4_test4</filename>: This model uses a global
     tripolar grid with roughly "3-degree" resolution and 28 vertical
     levels. The ocean is coupled to the GFDL sea ice model. Tracers
     include temperature and salinity, as well as the age, OCMIP
     biotic, and cfc tracer packages.  This model is aimed to test the
     capabilities of the multipe tracers available with mom4.  Note
     that the Sweby advection scheme is used here for all tracers, as
     is recommended by GFDL researchers.
   </para>
   <para>
     <filename>mom4_test5</filename>: This model uses a global
     tripolar grid with roughly "1-degree" resolution and 50 vertical
     levels. The ocean is coupled to the GFDL sea ice model.  The
     configuration is forced with the German OMIP dataset. Ocean
     tracers include potential temperature and salinity as well as the
     age tracer package.  This is a large model, and it is similar
     (though not the same) to the ocean and ice configuration used for
     the GFDL IPCC simulations.

   <title>Setting up an experiment with mom4</title>
     <para>
MOM4 is distributed with code used to generate model grids, initial
conditions, and boundary conditions.  Each step must be performed
prior to running the ocean model.  The steps used during this
experimental setup stage are generally termed "preprocessing", and the
code used for these purposes is under the /preprocessing directory in
the mom4 distribution.  The purpose of this section of the User Guide
is to outline this code and its usage.  Further details of usage and
algorithms can be found in the internal documentation within the
various preprocessing code modules.

We have endeavoured over the years to provide tools facilitating the
ready setup of a new experiment.  However, we remain unable to provide
code that does everything possible under the sun.  Additionally, all
features that are provided here may not be fully tested.
For these reasons, the preprocessing code continues to evolve as use
and functionality evolve.  We sincerely appreciate ALL comments about
code and documentation, especially comments regarding clarity,
completeness, and correctness.  Your input is essential for the
improvement of the code and documentation.
 </para><para>
--Many steps in idealized experiments that were formerly performed
while running earlier MOM versions have been extracted from mom4 and
placed into preprocessing.  Hence, even if you are running an
idealized experiment, it is likely that you will need to perform some
if not all of the preprocessing steps discussed here.

 <section id="Creation of the ocean/ice grid">
   <title>Creation of the ocean/ice grid</title>
  <para>
Within GFDL FMS, ocean and ice are assumed to share the same grid.
This means that the two models read in the same grid specification
file.  Even so, the domain decomposition on parallel systems may be
different, and indeed they generally are due to different load balance
issues between the two models.</para><para>

Even though the ocean and ice models read the same grid specification
file, they use the information from the grid file in a slightly
different manner when setting up the respective model's tracer grid.
In particular, the ocean model reads the tracer location directly from
the arrays (x_T/geolon_t, y_T/geolat_t) written in the grid
specification file.  In contrast, the GFDL ice model reads
(x_vert_T/geolon_vert_t, y_vert_T/geolat_vert_t) from the grid
specifcation file and then averages these four vertex locatons to get
the tracer location used in the ice model.  The result is that
diagnositics output from the two models have ocean and ice fields at
slightly different locations for cases such as the tripolar grid when
the grid is not spherical.</para><para>

The ocean/ice grid specification file is generated by executing the
ocean_grid_generator utility. The ocean_grid_generator utility
generates the horizontal grid, vertical grid, and topography. A
C-shell script is provided to compile relevant code to generate and
run the executable to produce the grid file. To create the desired
grid and topography, setting namelist options within the runscript is 
needed.</para>  
   
<para>
The horizontal grid can be conventional lon-lat spherical grid or a
reprojected rotated tripolar grid (R. Murray, "Explicit generation of
orthogonal grids for ocean models", 1996, J.Comp.Phys., v. 126,
p. 251-273.).  The choice is controlled by the namelist option
"tripolar grid" (true for tripolar grid and false for lon-lat
spherical grid).  Note that cartesian beta-plane and f-plane geometries 
are set up within mom4, not within the grid generation preprocesing 
steps discussed here (see mom4/ocean_core/ocean_grids.F90 for beta-plane 
and f-plane namelist options).</para><para>

The grid_spec file contains the following horizontal grid information:
geographic location of T,E,C and N-cell (Tracer, East, Corner, and
North cells), half and full cell lengths (in meters), rotation
information between logical (i.e., grid oriented) and geographic east
of cell. The complete description of the horizontal grid and namelist
option is available in <ulink url="../src/preprocessing/generate_grids/ocean/hgrid.html">
hgrid </ulink></para><para>

The vertical grid information includes depth of tracer points and
tracer_boundaries.  The complete description of namelist option is
available in <ulink url="../src/preprocessing/generate_grids/ocean/vgrid.html">
vgrid </ulink></para><para>

The topography can be idealized (various examples are provided and 
others can be easily added through emulating those provided) or remapped 
from a source topography dataset.  The type of topography is specified 
by the namelist variable "topography".  Namelist "topog_depend_on_vgrid" 
specifies if the topography will depend on the vertical grid or not. To 
generate a grid for mom4, "topog_depend_on_vgrid" should always be true. 
 A useful option for those upgrading older models to mom4 is 
"adjust_topo".  If this option is set to false, there will be no 
adjustments made to the topography.  See
<ulink url="../src/preprocessing/generate_grids/ocean/topog.html">
topog </ulink> for further details about topography namelist options.</para>
    </section>
<section id="The exchange grid for coupled models">
   <title>The exchange grid for coupled models</title>
     <para>
"Exchange grid" information is required for coupled models  (i.e., 
ocean/ice coupled to land and/or atmosphere) that employ the GFDL 
coupler technology.  The exchange grid is defined by taking the union of 
the ocean/ice grid with the atmosphere and land grids.  This union is 
then used to compute area integrals to allow for conservative mapping of 
fluxes between the component models.

     </textobject>
   </inlinemediaobject>
The exchange grid information is generated by executing the make_xgrids 
utility. The execution of the make_xgrids utility will generate a netcdf 
file with the name grid_spec.nc. The grid_spec.nc contains the component 
model grids as well as the exchange grid information.  In particular, 
the utility make_xgrids generates two exchange grids used by the FMS 
coupler: one grid for surface fluxes and another for runoff.<command>
make_xgrids</command> is created by compiling its C source:</para><para>

standard math libraries.  It is executed with the command</para><para>
<programlisting>
make_xgrids -o ocean_grid.nc -a atmos_grid.nc -l land_grid.nc</programlisting>
</para><para>

This execultion produces a grid_spec.nc file (input files containing 
grid information for the ocean/sea-ice, atmosphere and land component 
models are indicated by the -o, -a and -l flags, respectively).  The 
grid files  ocean_grid.nc,  atmosphere_grid.nc, and land_grid.nc all can 
be generated separately through the ocean_grid_generator utility. 
Normally at GFDL we select the same atmosphere and land model grid, but 
such is not necessary. When the land and atmosphere grids are the same, 
then we can reduce the execute command to</para><para><programlisting>
make_xgrids -o ocean_grid.nc -a atmos_grid.nc</programlisting>
</para><para>

If you further decide to choose same ocean, atmosphere and land grid, 
the execute command will be</para><para><programlisting>
make_xgrids -o ocean_grid.nc -a ocean_grid.nc</programlisting>
</para><para>
make_xgrids expects a netCDF format input specification for each of the 
component model grid files.  For the ice/ocean grid (ocean_grid.nc), the 
following three fields are required:</para><para>

1. wet - a 2D array of double precision numbers set to 1.0 where the
ice and ocean models are active and 0.0 elsewhere. wet has im indices
in the i-direction (pseudo east-west) and jm indices in the j-direction 
(pseudo north-south). These correspond to the size of the global arrays 
of temperature, salinity and ice thickness in the coupled climate model.
</para><para>

2. x_vert_T and y_vert_T - 3D double precision arrays (dimensioned
im * jm * 4) that contain the longitudes and latitudes (respectively) of 
the four corners of T- cells.  The numbers are in degrees.
</para><para>

For the netCDF format input specification for the atmosphere and land 
grid (atmos_grid.nc and/or land_grid.nc), x_vert_T and y_vert_t are 
required.</para><para>

<command>make_xgrids</command> copies all fields of the ice/ocean grid specification file
to its output file, grid_spec.nc, and then appends fields that specify
the atmosphere and land model grids and then the surface and runoff
exchange grids.
</para><para>
Using the Sutherland-Hodgeman polygon clipping algorithm (reference in 
next paragraph) for model cell interaction calculation, make_xgrids 
takes care that the land and ocean grids perfectly tile the sphere. The 
land model's domain is defined as that part of the sphere not covered by 
ocean (where wet=0 on the ocean grid). To accomplish this, the land 
cells must be modified to remove the ocean parts. This is done in 
make_xgrids by first taking the intersections of atmosphere and land 
cells. The overlap area between these cells and active ocean cells are 
then subtracted. Finally, the modified atmosphere/land intersections are 
aggregated into land cell areas and atmosphere/land exchange cell areas.
</para><para>

Model cell intersections are calculated using the Sutherland-Hodgeman
polygon clipping algorithm (Sutherland, I. E. and G. W. Hodgeman,
1974: Reentrant polygon clipping, CACM, 17(1), 32-42.).  This
algorithm finds the intersection of a convex and arbitrary polygon by
successively removing the portion of the latter that is "outside" each
boundary of the former. It can be found in many computer graphics text
books (e.g., Foley, J. D., A. van Dam, S. K. Feiner, and J. F. Hughes,
1990: Computer graphics: principles and practice, second
edition. Addison Wesley, 1174 pp.).  The implementation in make_xgrids
is particularly simple because the clipping polygon is always a
rectangle in longitude/latitude space. For the purpose of finding the
line intersections in the clipping operations, the cell boundaries are
assumed to be straight lines in longitude/latitude space. This
treatment is only perfectly accurate for cells bounded by lines of
longitude and latitude.
</para><para>

Spherical areas are calculated by taking the integral of the negative
sine of latitude around the boundary of a polygon (Jones, P. W., 1999:
First- and second-order conservative remapping schemes for grids in
spherical coordinates. Monthly Weather Review, 127, 2204-2210.). The
integration pathways are again straight lines in longitude/latitude
space. make_xgrids checks that the sphere and the individual cells of
the atmosphere and ocean grids are tiled by the surface exchange
cells. The fractional tiling errors are reported.

and boundary conditions (ICs and BCs).  These conditions are specific
to the details of the model grid, so it is necessary to have the grid
specificiation file in hand before moving to the IC and BC generation.
</para><para>
There are two options for ICs and BCs.
</para><para>
--Idealized Conditions.  These conditions are based on subroutines
that design idealized setups for either initial conditions (e.g.,
exponential temperature profile) or boundary conditions (e.g., cosine
zonal wind stress).  Code for these purposes is found in the
idealized_ic and idealized_bc directories in the mom4 distribution.
Details of available namelist choices are in the documentation file
idealized_ic.html as well as the comments within the source code
itself.  Users can readily incorporate their favorite idealized IC or
BC into the mom4 idealized preprocessing step by emulating the code
provided.
</para><para>
--Realistic Conditions.  These ICs and BCs generally result from a
regridding routine to bring, say, the Levitus analysis onto the model
grid for initializing a model, or for mapping surface fluxes onto the
grid for boundary conditions.  Code enabling the regridding functions
is found in the preprocessing/regrid_2d, preprocessing/regrid_3d and
preprocessing/regrid directories in the mom4 distribution.

In the remainder of this section, we detail code to generate the ICs

   <title>2d Regridding: the common approach</title>
      <para>
It is typical for air-sea fluxes of momentum, heat, and mosture to
live on a grid distinct from the ocean model grid.  In particular,
most analyses are placed on a spherical latitude-longitude grid,
whereas most global ocean models configured from mom4 are run with
tripolar grids.
</para><para>
When running an ocean or ocean-ice model, it is useful to map the
boundary fluxes onto the ocean model grid prior to the experiment.
This preprocessing step saves computational time that would otherwise
be needed if the fluxes were mapped each time step of a running
experiment.  To enable this regridding, one should access code in the
preprocessing/regrid_2d directory.  The original data must be on a
latitude-longitude grid to use regrid_2d.  The target/destination grid
can be either latitude-longitude with arbitrary resolution, or
tripolar with arbitrary resolution.

<para>
In some cases, one may wish to take a set of forcing fields from one

necessary to regrid before running the experiment.
</para><para>
As of the mom4p0d distribution, there is a regridding tool within the
preprocessing/regrid directory that enables one to regrid fields on
one tripolar grid to another tripolar grid. Indeed, one can regrid
source data from any logically rectangular grid (e.g.,
latitude-longitude grid or tripolar grid) to a target/destination grid
that is any logically rectangular grid.

<section id="Regridding river runoff data">
   <title>Regridding river runoff data</title>
<para>
The tool preprocessing/runoff_regrid is of use to grid river runoff
data onto the ocean model grid.  In this case, runoff is moved to a
nearest ocean/land boundary point on the new grid.  Note that the
source runoff dataset must be on a spherical latitude-longitude grid,
whereas the target/destination grid can be spherical or tripolar.  The
regridding algorithm is conservative.
</para><para>
The conservative regridding scheme used in runoff_regrid is an area
average scheme, which is similiar to the algorithm used in coupler
flux exchange.  If any land point has runoff data, after remapping
runoff data onto destination grid, the runoff value of that land point
will be moved to the nearest ocean point. Before using this tool, you
must use make_xgrids to generate exchange grid information between the
source grid and destination grid. The complete descritpion can be
found in runoff_regrid.html.

   <title>Two ways to specify surface boundary fluxes</title>
<para>


There are two ways to specify surface boundary fluxes when using the
coupler feature of FMS. One is through flux exchange, and this employs
a conservative algorithm as appropriate for running a coupled
ocean-atmosphere model.  It is assumed that the atmospheric model grid
is spherical with arbitrary resolution.  The other method is through
data override, and this uses a non-conservative scheme.  Data override
is of use to selectively remove, say, one of the fluxes coming from an
atmospheric model and replace this flux with that from data.  GFDL
modelers have found this feature to be very useful in diagnosing
problems with a coupled model.

<section id="3d Regridding for ICs or Sponges">
   <title>3d Regridding for initial conditions or sponges</title>
<para>


When generating realistic initial conditions for an ocean experiment,
one generally requires the gridding of temperature and salinity, such
as from the Levitus analysis product, onto the model's grid.  For this
purpose, we are in need of vertical grid information in addition to
horizontal 2d information required for the surface boundary
conditions.  Hence, we use the preprocessing/regrid_3d. A similar
procedure is required to develop sponge data.
</para><para>
The original data must be on a spherical grid in order to use
regrid_3d.  If the original data is on a tripolar grid, we should use
preprocessing/regrid, which can map data from any logical rectangular
grid onto any logical rectangular grid.

   <title>Comments on the regridding algorithms</title>
<para>


For preprocessing/regrid_3d, preprocessing/regrid_2d and
preprocessing/regrid, regridding is accomplished non-conservatively
using a nearest neighbor distance weighting algorithm, or bilinear
interpolation.  The interpolation algorithm is controlled through the
namelist option "interp_method".
</para><para>
Bilinear interpolation is recommanded for most cases since it provides
a smooth interpolation when regridding from coarse grid to fine grid
(the usual situation with model destination grids typically having
resolution more refined than source data products), and it is more
efficient.  Efficiency can become a particularly important issue when
developing initial and boundary conditions for a refined resolution
model.
</para><para>
If the original data is on a tripolar grid, nearest neighbor distance
weighting interpolation found in preprocessing/regrid must be used,
since bilinear interpolation assumes the original data is on a
latitude-longitude grid.  For preprocessing/regrid_2d,
preprocessing/regrid_3d and preprocessing/regrid using the nearest
neighbor distance weighting algorithm, a maximum distance (in radians)
can be selected using the namelist value max_dist. Namelist option
"num_nbrs" can be adjusted for speed, although for most applications
this refinement is not necessary.

 It is likely that you will encounter an error using "off-the-shelf" NetCDF files to force your ocean
model. This could be due to inadequate metadata in the forcing files, mis-specification of the DataTable,
or errors in the parsing of the axis information by axis_utils or get_cal_time. You'll need some tools
to help you diagnose problems and apply the required fix. </para><para>

The first thing you should do to setup a new forcing file is use the
test program:<command> 
 time_interp_external_mod:test_time_interp_external</command>. This test program calls time_interp_external
at user-specified model times and returns information on how the times were decoded and the 
resulting interpolation indices and weights. It is STRONGLY suggested that you pass your
forcing files through this program before including them in your model configuration.
As you gain familiarity with the metadata requirements, you will more easily be able to identify errors
and save a lot of time debugging.</para><para>

Modifying the file metadata should hopefully prove straightforward. The

Currently, the FMS time_manager does not support the Gregorian calendar. So, for instance if you have
forcing data that are encoded using the Gregorian calendar which has an average year length of 365.2425
days compared with the Julian calendar with an average year length of 365.25 days, assuming Julian
calendar encoding will result in a drift of 0.75 days/100 years. If your forcing times are referenced
to an early date such as "0001-01-01" your times will drift by 15 days by the year 2000. Until the
Gregorian calendar is implemented in the FMS code, the recommended solution is to change the reference
date in the forcing dataset using an application such as Ferret, click

For many analysis applications, it is sufficient, and often
preferable, to have output on the model's native grid (i.e., the grid
used to run the simulation).  Accurate computation of budgets, for
example, must be done on the model's native grid, preferably online
during integration. MOM4 provides numerous online diagnostics for this
purpose. </para><para>
Many applications, such as model comparison projects, require results
on a common latitude-longitude spherical grid.  Such facilitates the
development of difference maps.  For this purpose, we have developed a
tool to regrid scalar and vector fields from a tripolar grid to a
spherical grid.  In principle, this tool can be used to regrid any
logically rectangular gridded field onto a spherical grid.  However,
applications at GFDL have been limited to the tripolar to spherical
regrid case. </para><para>
In general, regridding is a difficult task to perform accurately and
without producing noise or spurious results.  The user should
carefully examine regridding results for their physical
integrity. Problems occur, in particular, with fields near mom4's
partial bottom step topography in the presence of realistic topography
and land/sea geometry.  Indeed, we were unable to find a simple
algorithm to handle regridding in the vertical that did not produce
egregious levels of noise. Hence, the regridding tool provided with
mom4 only handles horizontal regridding. The regridded data will thus
be on the source vertical grid. </para><para>
Model comparisons should ideally be performed only after regridding
output using the same regridding algorithm.  Unfortunately, such is
not generally the case since there is no standard regridding algorithm
used in the modeling community. </para><para>
Please note that the regridding code is relatively new at GFDL. We
greatly appreciate user's feedback.      </para>

The algorithm accepts data from any logically rectangular grid (e.g.,
tripolar or latitude-longitude) and regrids to a spherical
latitude-longitude grid. When the data is on the tracer cell (T-cell),
the regridding interpolation is conservative. Thus, total heat, salt,
and passive tracer remain the same on the two grids.  However, when
data is located at another position:  </para>

     In the first section of the field table, the user can specify tracers to
     be used in the simulation. Although there is no limit to the number of
     tracers specified, temperature (<literal>temp</literal>) and salinity
     (<literal>salt</literal>) must be included. The user may also define the
     horizontal and vertical tracer advection schemes. For more information on the field manager,
     reference <ulink url="../src/shared/field_manager/field_manager.html">
     field_manager.html</ulink>.
   </para>
   <para>
     In climate modeling, it is often necessary to allow water masses that are
     separated by land to exchange tracer and surface height properties. This
     situation arises in models when the grid mesh is too coarse to resolve
     narrow passageways that in reality provide crucial connections between
     water masses. The cross-land mixing and cross-land insertion
     establishes communication between
     bodies of water separated by land. The communication consists of mixing
     tracers and volume between non-adjacent water columns. Momentum is not
     mixed. The scheme conserves total tracer content, total volume, and
     maintains compatibility between the tracer and volume budgets.
     The grid points where this exchange takes place, and the rates of
     the exchange, are specified in the field table. 
   </para>
   <para>
     For some cases, it is necessary to set a large vertical tracer
     diffusivity at a specified point in the model, say next to a
     river mouth to ensure fresh water is mixed vertically.  These
     diffusivities are specified in the field table.

     There are several graphical packages available to display the model
     output. These packages vary widely depending on factors, such as the
     number of dimensions, the amount and complexity of options available and
     the output data format. The data will first have to be put into a common
     format that all the packages can read. FMS requires the data to be stored
     in
     <ulink url="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/">NetCDF</ulink>
     format since it is so widely supported for scientific visualization. The
     graphical package is also dependent upon the computing environment. For

    <para>
An often frustrating aspect of numerical modeling is getting the 
computational environment set up so the model compiles, executes, 
completes, and saves data in a smooth and dependable manner.  There are 
numerous platform configurations, compiler variations, data storage 
capabilities, and experimental designs that make it likely that each 
user will encounter unique issues.
</para><para>
At GFDL, we try to develop code that is portable and readily usable on 
many platforms.  Nonetheless, given the multitude of configurations, we 
cannot anticipate all problems.  So users should expect to spend some 
time setting up the model's computational environment when downloading 
the code for the first time.
</para><para>
We rely on users within the mom4 community to provide feedback regarding 
how they got the model to run on their respective platforms.  We greatly 
appreciate when users send their "progress report" to the mom4 email 
list.  We solicit information on issues that may make future releases 
less problematic.  We also appreciate your detailed documentation that 
may approach "hand holding" to better allow new users to successfully 
run the model.  Indeed, imagine being a fresh graduate student or 
postdoc, only just recently learning Unix and Fortran, aiming to 
download and run mom4 on their PC!  The more experienced users 
share knowledge in a digested and organized manner, the easier it will 
be for others to realize success with the code.
</para><para>
The purpose of this section is to organize some of the many emails that 
have been sent to the mom4 email list that focus on computational 
platform issues.  Given limited resources and limited access to 
platforms outside GFDL, we have not edited these emails. Users who wish 
to update or edit information provided in an earlier email please feel 
free to do so.

MOM4 is an evolving code.  As features are added or removed, bugs are
resolved, and documentation clarified, we aim to provide the user
community with access to our latest code used in-house at GFDL.  The
purpose of this section is to summarize the main features of each
model version.
</para><para>
For new users, please download the most recent release.  For those
having used mom4 for sometime, your need to update should be based on
a balance between accessing new features or bug fixes versus the
overhead needed to update your respective model experiments.  It is
recommended that you access new versions of mom4 only after completion
of a particular line of research, rather than updating in the middle.
Notably, we do not ensure that each update is fully backwards
compatible.

     The following lists some new features of the MOM4p0c release in
     August 2004. 

     <warning>
 <itemizedlist>
 
     <listitem>
      MOM4p0c will NOT bitwise reproduce earlier MOM4
      releases.  However, major changes in answers beyond roundoff
      differences should not be expected when running in an analogous
      configuration.

     <listitem>
      The time tendency for tracer and baroclinic velocity can be
      discretized two ways. (1) The first approach uses the
      traditional leap-frog method along with a Robert-Asselin time
      filter. (2) MOM4p0c provides an additional method, which is
      strongly recommended.  Here, the time tendency is discretized
      with a two-level forward step, which eliminates the need to time
      filter.  Tracer and velocity are staggered in time, thus
      providing second order accuracy in time.  For certain model
      configurations, this scheme is roughly twice as stable as the
      leap-frog, thus allowing for a factor of two in computational
      savings.  Without the time filtering needed with the leap-frog,
      the new scheme conserves total tracer to within numerical
      roundoff.  Extensive tests indicate that the simulations are
      quite similar qualitatively and quantitatively to those run with
      the leap-frog scheme.  However, the user is encouraged to verify
      such prior to moving forward with the new time stepping scheme.
      Note that the new scheme shares much in common with time
      stepping used in the Hallberg Isopycnal Model and the MIT GCM.
      This new scheme is the default in MOM4p0c.
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       The barotropic mode can be updated using either the older
       leap-frog method, or a newer defaulted predictor-corrector
       method motivated by a similar method used in the Hallberg
       Isopycnal Model.
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       Thickness weighted tracer concentration and thickness weighted
       baroclinic velocity are updated, rather than tracer
       concentration and velocity.  This new approach provides simpler
       conservation budgets, in which there is no longer a source-like
       term associated with the time tendency of the surface height.
      </listitem>     

      <listitem>
       Optimizations have been implemented to reduce array syntax and
       to improve parallelization.  This work is ongoing, with
       assistance from the MOM4 user community greatly appreciated.
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       A new derived type has been introduced: ocean_thickness_type.
       This type absorbs elements of the ocean_grid_type that invove
       time dependent thicknesses of layers.  It is anticipated that
       this type will expand in the future as MOM4 evolves towards
       generalized vertical coordinates.  This change required
       interfaces changes.
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       The Time derived type has been removed from the other derived
       types in order to simplify the definitions of the types. This
       change required interfaces changes.  
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       The non-Boussinesq option has been jettisoned in order to
       simplify some of the code.  It is anticipated that the next
       release of MOM4 will be MOM4p1 (late 2004 or early 2005), and
       this code will include a pressure-coordinate option to allow
       for simpler implementation of non-Boussinesq
       kinematics/dynamics.

       Extensive work has been included to enhance the portability and
       flexibility of FMS codes. This work is ongoing, with assistance
       from the MOM4 user community greatly appreciated.
      </listitem>

     <listitem>
     The new version of <ulink
     url="../src/shared/time_manager/time_manager.html"><filename>shared/time_manager.f90
     </filename></ulink> requires that every dataset with a time
     dimension also have a calendar attribute associated with this
     time. This new attribute is now required because problems were
     found with the old time manager when running the model assuming a
     repeating annual cycle using the NOLEAP calendar type, yet
     without the datasets also having this calendar type.  A spurious
     shift in the date accumulated over time, which caused shifts in
     the forcing relative to what the model intended.  The calendar
     attribute is missing from many datasets released with mom4p0a and
     mom4p0b. Since the missing of calendar attribute would cause a
     fatal error in mom4p0c release, NEW datasets that
     have calendar attribute are required for mom4p0c release.	  
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
      Because getting NetCDF datasets in a proper format for FMS code
      remains a frustrating aspect of running MOM4, we have provided a
      new stand-alone utility that tests a data file for compatibility
      with FMS.  This utility is in
      <ulink
      url="../src/shared/time_interp/time_interp_external.html"><filename>shared/time_interp_external.F90</filename></ulink>
      and there is an associated run script at src/preprocessing/test_time_interp_ext that the user should
      modify for their machines.  Use of this utility to debug the
      datasets prior to running MOM4 can help to remove a significant
      level of frustration associated with building a new model with
      new datasets.
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
       Another substantial update to the FMS infrastructure involves
       the mpp code, such as <ulink
       url="../src/shared/mpp/mpp.html"><filename>shared/mpp.F90
       </filename></ulink>. This code has been significantly
       reorganized for easier understanding, and many new features
       have been added.  One new feature that has been found quite
       useful is that it is now possible to update a set of fields
       across processors after accumulating the full set, rather than
       sending each member individually.  In general, sending one very
       large package of data for mpp_update_domains is far more
       efficient than sending multiple smaller packages.  This new
       feature is most useful, for example, when sending multiple
       tracers or tracer tendencies for updates in modules such as
       ocean_neutral_physics.F90 and tracer advection.  (Note that
       only the Sweby advection scheme has been modified to allow for
       this improved efficiency.  Other schemes can be modified
       similarly.  Since they are not commonly used at GFDL, they have
       not been modified).

add a namelist "search_method" to horiz_interp_spherical_nml. The reason

you can always set search_method to "full_search", which will be always accurate but
less efficiency comparing to "radial_search". "radial_search" is the default value.
In most cases, "radial_search" and "full_search" will produce same results other than
order of operation. With "radial_search", it is important to choose suitable max_dist
(an optional argument in horiz_interp_spherical_init).

Redesign this regrid tool. Change the interpolation algorithm for tracer

latitude-longitude grid) to any latitude-longitude grid. Removed namelist
do_vertical_interp. This tool will not do vertical interpolation. The reason
is that the linear vertical interpolation will create some unwanted
noises.
